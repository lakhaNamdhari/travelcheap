travelCheap a platform that would enable travellers to get cabs at affordable and competitive price.

As if now the Cab fare is controlled by the cab operating companies. The cab users are forced to pay the price that company sets.
These companies are also charging a hefty amount from cab drivers in exchange of trips. So overall cab users are paying more, cab drivers are paying more and this is all going to the cab operating companies.

travelCheap aims to give freedom to cab users and drivers.
